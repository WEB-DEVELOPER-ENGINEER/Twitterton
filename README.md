# Twitterton
A Flask-based web application that allows users to write tweets and schedule them or use Ai to write the tweets for them. The app utilizes the Tweepy library for tweeting and OpenAI for creating the tweets. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing tweet schedules.

## Features
- **Schedule Tweets**: Create and schedule tweets to be posted at specific dates and times.
- **Tweet Management**: View and delete scheduled tweets.
- **Automatic Tweet Posting**: A worker script (`tweet.py`) continuously runs in the background, checking the scheduled tweets, and automatically posts them at the specified times.
- **AI functionality**: Automatically creates tweets from your prompt.
